### Introduction Question

### 1. Tell me about yourself?

Sure, I'd be happy to provide an overview of my background. I have over 9 years of experience in backend development, starting my career in 2014 after completing my Bachelor of Engineering.
In the initial years, I focused on web application development using PHP (Laravel) and MySQL,
working extensively with AWS services. This laid a strong foundation for my understanding of web technologies and cloud computing.
Over the last 4 years, I transitioned to Golang and embraced containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes. During this period, I specialized in building microservices using REST architecture. This shift allowed me to contribute to more scalable and modular systems.
I've had the opportunity to work on projects in the fintech and banking domains, gaining valuable experience in developing robust and secure web applications.  My recent focus has been on cloud services, aligning with the industry's move towards scalable and flexible cloud-based architectures.
Looking forward, my goal is to continue leveraging emerging technologies to create innovative and efficient solutions. I am particularly interested in exploring advancements in cloud-native development, further honing my expertise in building resilient and scalable systems.
Additionally, I aspire to take on leadership roles where I can contribute not only technically but also by guiding and mentoring other team members. I am enthusiastic about staying at the forefront of technological trends, continuously learning, and applying that knowledge to drive success in dynamic and challenging environments.
In the long term, I am keen on contributing to projects that have a positive societal impact, possibly exploring opportunities where technology can be a catalyst for positive change.
I believe that a combination of technical expertise, leadership skills, and a forward-looking approach will enable me to make meaningful contributions to the projects I undertake.



### 2. What was your aspirations in your 9 years of experience journey?

Throughout my 9 years of experience, my aspirations have evolved in tandem with the dynamic nature of the technology landscape. In the early stages of my career, my primary focus was on honing my technical skills and gaining hands-on experience in web application development. I was driven by a desire to understand the intricacies of building robust and scalable systems.
As I progressed, my aspirations expanded to encompass a more holistic view of software development. I became increasingly interested in the strategic aspects of technology, such as architecting solutions that not only meet current needs but also anticipate future challenges. This led me to explore emerging technologies, particularly in the realm of cloud computing and microservices architecture.
In the last few years, my aspirations have further matured. I've developed a keen interest in leadership and mentoring, aspiring to contribute not just as an individual contributor but also as a guide and mentor to my team. I find fulfillment in fostering a collaborative and innovative work environment, where collective knowledge and expertise drive success.
Looking ahead, I am excited about the prospect of combining my technical acumen with leadership responsibilities. My goal is to contribute to projects that not only leverage cutting-edge technologies but also make a positive impact on the industry and society. I see my journey as a continuous evolution, where each experience has shaped my aspirations and equipped me with the skills needed for new challenges.
