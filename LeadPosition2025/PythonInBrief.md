### Python (Leadership Level)

#### Advanced Python Concepts

* **Decorators:**
    * **Concept:** Functions that take another function as an argument and return a new function, typically extending or modifying the behavior of the original function without directly altering its code.
    * **Syntax:** `@decorator_name` above a function definition.
    * **Use Cases (Leadership):**
        * **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming):** Adding cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, authorization, caching, retry logic, timing, or validation to multiple functions.
        * **Framework Development:** Used extensively in web frameworks (e.g., Flask's `@app.route`, Django's `@login_required`).
        * **Code Readability/Maintainability:** Keeps core logic clean by externalizing repetitive tasks.
    * **Nuance:** Understand `functools.wraps` to preserve metadata (docstrings, name) of the decorated function, and how to write decorators that accept arguments.

* **Metaclasses:**
    * **Concept:** "Classes of classes." A metaclass defines how a class is created. `type` is the default metaclass for all Python classes. When you define a class, Python uses `type` to construct it.
    * **Use Cases (Leadership/Advanced Architecture):**
        * **API/ORM Frameworks:** Used to dynamically create models or enforce specific class structures (e.g., ensuring all model classes have a `table_name` attribute).
        * **Plugin Systems:** Automatically register classes that inherit from a specific base class.
        * **Enforcing Design Patterns/Coding Standards:** Ensure certain methods exist or specific naming conventions are followed across a large codebase.
        * **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs):** Creating highly customized class behavior.
    * **Nuance:** Highly powerful but complex. Use sparingly and only when standard inheritance or decorators aren't sufficient. Interviewers will look for understanding of the "why" and "when," not just "how."

* **Context Managers:**
    * **Concept:** Objects that define a runtime context, typically for resource management (e.g., files, network connections, locks). They ensure setup and teardown operations are performed reliably, even if errors occur.
    * **Syntax:** Used with the `with` statement. `with open('file.txt', 'r') as f: ...`
    * **How they work:** Implement `__enter__` (for setup, returns the resource) and `__exit__` (for cleanup, handles exceptions).
    * **`contextlib` module:** Provides utilities like `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator for writing context managers using a generator function.
    * **Use Cases (Leadership):**
        * **Database Connections:** Ensuring connections are closed.
        * **File Handling:** Automatically closing files.
        * **Locking Mechanisms:** Acquiring and releasing locks (`threading.Lock`, `asyncio.Lock`).
        * **Temporary State Changes:** Temporarily altering settings or environment variables.
        * **Resource Pools:** Managing the lifecycle of resources from a pool.
    * **Nuance:** Reduces boilerplate, improves readability, and makes code more robust by guaranteeing resource cleanup.

#### Async Programming

* **`asyncio`, `async/await` patterns:**
    * **Concept:** Python's standard library for writing concurrent code using the `async/await` syntax. Enables cooperative multitasking on a single thread. Tasks yield control to the event loop when awaiting an I/O operation (e.g., network request, disk access).
    * **`async def`:** Defines a coroutine, a function that can be paused and resumed.
    * **`await`:** Used *inside* an `async` function to pause execution until an awaitable (another coroutine, a Future, or a Task) completes.
    * **Event Loop:** The core of `asyncio` that schedules and runs coroutines. `asyncio.run(main_coroutine())` is the recommended entry point.
    * **Use Cases (Leadership):**
        * **I/O-bound applications:** Web servers (FastAPI, Starlette, Sanic), network proxies, long-polling applications, microservice communication.
        * **High-concurrency tasks:** When you need to handle many concurrent connections or requests efficiently without high CPU usage.
    * **Nuance:**
        * **Best Practices:** Always `await` coroutines; use `async with` for async context managers; handle `asyncio.CancelledError`; use `asyncio.gather` for running multiple coroutines concurrently.
        * **Pitfalls:** Forgetting to `await` a coroutine (it creates a coroutine object but doesn't run it); blocking the event loop with synchronous (blocking) I/O or CPU-bound tasks (use `loop.run_in_executor()` for these); not handling exceptions in async tasks.
        * **Debugging:** `asyncio` debug mode can be enabled.

#### Concurrency & Parallelism

* **Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing (GIL implications):**
    * **Concurrency:** Deals with many things at once (tasks appear to run simultaneously, often by interleaving execution). Achieved by `asyncio` (cooperative multitasking on a single thread) and `threading`.
    * **Parallelism:** Truly doing many things at once (tasks run simultaneously on multiple CPU cores). Achieved by `multiprocessing`.
    * **Multithreading (`threading` module):**
        * **Concept:** Runs multiple threads within the same process. Threads share the same memory space.
        * **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) Implications:** **Crucial for Python.** The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes *simultaneously*. This means Python **multithreading does NOT achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.**
        * **Use Cases:** Best for **I/O-bound tasks** (e.g., network requests, reading/writing files) because the GIL is released during I/O operations, allowing other threads to run.
        * **Pitfalls:** Race conditions, deadlocks (require careful use of `threading.Lock`, `RLock`, `Semaphore`).
    * **Multiprocessing (`multiprocessing` module):**
        * **Concept:** Creates separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.
        * **GIL Implications:** Since each process has its own GIL, `multiprocessing` **can achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks** by utilizing multiple CPU cores.
        * **Use Cases:** Best for **CPU-bound tasks** (e.g., heavy computations, data processing).
        * **Pitfalls:** Higher overhead for process creation and inter-process communication (IPC - queues, pipes, shared memory).
    * **Leadership Role:** Know how to identify if a task is I/O-bound or CPU-bound and choose the appropriate concurrency model. Explain the GIL's role clearly.

* **Concurrency Best Practices, Pitfalls (Deadlock, Race Conditions):**
    * **Race Condition:** When the outcome of concurrent operations depends on the non-deterministic order of execution. Example: Two threads trying to increment a shared counter without a lock.
    * **Deadlock:** A situation where two or more processes/threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release a resource (e.g., Thread A holds Lock 1 and waits for Lock 2; Thread B holds Lock 2 and waits for Lock 1).
    * **Best Practices:**
        * **Use Locks (`threading.Lock`, `asyncio.Lock`):** Protect shared mutable data. Use `with` statement for context managers.
        * **Queues:** Use `queue.Queue` (thread-safe), `multiprocessing.Queue` (process-safe), or `asyncio.Queue` for safe communication between concurrent units, avoiding shared state.
        * **Immutable Data:** Prefer immutable data structures where possible to reduce shared state issues.
        * **Minimize Shared State:** Design systems to reduce the need for shared mutable state.
        * **Thorough Testing:** Use tools like `pytest-asyncio` for async testing, and ensure good unit/integration tests for concurrent logic.
        * **Clear Ownership:** Define clear ownership of data and resources to prevent accidental modification.
    * **Troubleshooting:** Debugging concurrent issues is notoriously hard. Explain strategies like simplified test cases, logging, and using tools like `pdb` (with care).

#### Generators & Iterators

* **Understanding `yield`:**
    * **Concept:** The `yield` keyword makes a function a **generator function**. When called, it doesn't run the function immediately but returns a **generator iterator**.
    * **Behavior:** When `yield` is encountered, the function's state is frozen, and the yielded value is returned to the caller. The next time `next()` is called on the generator, execution resumes from where it left off.
    * **Contrast with `return`:** `return` terminates a function; `yield` pauses and allows resumption.

* **Memory Efficiency with Generators:**
    * **Key Advantage:** Generators produce values **on demand** (lazily) rather than creating and storing all values in memory upfront (eagerly, like a list).
    * **Example:**
        * `my_list = [i for i in range(1_000_000)]` (creates a list in memory, uses significant RAM)
        * `my_generator = (i for i in range(1_000_000))` (creates a generator object, uses minimal RAM until values are iterated)
    * **Use Cases (Leadership):**
        * **Processing Large Datasets/Files:** Reading line by line from a huge log file without loading the entire file into memory.
        * **Infinite Sequences:** Generating Fibonacci numbers or random data indefinitely.
        * **Data Pipelines:** Chaining multiple generator functions to process data streams efficiently.
    * **Nuance:** Generators can only be iterated over once. If you need to traverse the data multiple times, you'd typically convert it to a list (materialize it) or recreate the generator.

#### Python Garbage Collection

* **Python Garbage Collection:** Python automatically manages memory. It uses two primary mechanisms:
    * **Reference Counting:**
        * **Concept:** Every Python object has a "reference count," which is the number of variables, containers, etc., that are currently pointing to it.
        * **Mechanism:** When an object's reference count drops to zero, it means no one is referring to it anymore, and its memory can be immediately deallocated. This is the primary and most frequent form of GC.
        * `sys.getrefcount()` can be used to inspect.
        * **Limitation:** Cannot handle **cyclic references**. If Object A refers to Object B, and Object B refers to Object A, their reference counts will never drop to zero even if no external references exist.

    * **Generational Garbage Collection (aka Cycle Detector / Mark-and-Sweep):**
        * **Concept:** This mechanism runs periodically to collect objects that have survived reference counting, specifically targeting cyclic references.
        * **Generations:** Objects are grouped into three generations (0, 1, 2) based on their age. Newer objects are in Generation 0 and are collected more frequently, based on the observation that most objects are short-lived. Objects that survive a collection are promoted to an older generation.
        * **Mark-and-Sweep:** When a collection runs, it "marks" all reachable objects starting from known roots (e.g., global variables, stack frames). Then, it "sweeps" (deallocates) all unmarked objects. This process can detect and break cyclic references.
        * **`gc` module:** Provides an interface to the garbage collector (`gc.collect()`, `gc.get_objects()`, `gc.set_debug()`).

* **Memory Profiling:**
    * **Purpose:** Identifying where your program is consuming memory, detecting memory leaks, and optimizing memory usage.
    * **Tools:**
        * **`memory_profiler`:** A third-party package (`pip install memory_profiler`) that allows you to profile line-by-line memory usage in functions. Use `@profile` decorator.
        * **`objgraph`:** Visualizes reference graphs and helps identify memory leaks caused by unwanted references.
        * **`heapy`:** Provides detailed statistics about objects in memory.
        * **`sys.getsizeof()`:** Returns the size of an object in bytes.
        * **`gc.get_objects()`:** Inspects all objects currently tracked by the garbage collector.
    * **Leadership Role:** Understand how to use these tools to diagnose memory issues in production systems and guide architectural decisions to build memory-efficient applications. Explain strategies like using generators, efficient data structures, and avoiding global state where possible.
