## Golang: Detailed Preparation Topics

#### 1. Basic syntax, data types, and control structures

* **Syntax:** Go's syntax is clean and C-like. Semicolons are optional (automatically inserted). `package main` and `func main()` are entry points.
* **Data Types:**
    * **Numeric:** `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128`, `byte`, `rune`.
    * **Boolean:** `bool` (true/false).
    * **String:** `string` (UTF-8 encoded).
* **Control Structures:**
    * `if`/`else if`/`else`: Standard conditional execution.
    * `for`: Go's only loop construct (can act as `while`, `for-each`, or infinite loop).
    * `switch`: Multi-way conditional. `fallthrough` is explicit.
    * `defer`: Schedules a function call to be run after the surrounding function returns. Used for cleanup.

#### 2. Functions, methods, and structs

* **Functions:** Declared with `func`. Can return multiple values. Arguments are passed by value (unless using pointers).
* **Methods:** Functions associated with a specific type (receiver). Defined using `(receiver_name receiver_type)` before the function name.
    * `Value receiver`: Works on a copy of the value.
    * `Pointer receiver`: Works on the original value, allowing modification.
* **Structs:** User-defined composite types that group together zero or more named fields. Similar to classes but without methods directly attached (methods are defined separately with a receiver).

#### 3. Anonymous, Closure, and Variadic functions

* **Anonymous Functions:** Functions without a name. Often used as arguments to other functions or for immediate execution (IIFE).
    ```go
    func() { /* ... */ }() // Immediately invoked
    ```
* **Closures:** Anonymous functions that "close over" the variables from the lexical scope in which they are declared, even after that scope has exited.
    ```go
    func outer() func() int {
        x := 0
        return func() int {
            x++
            return x
        }
    }
    ```
* **Variadic Functions:** Functions that accept a variable number of arguments of a specific type using `...` (e.g., `func sum(nums ...int)`). The arguments are then accessed as a slice within the function.

#### 4. `new` vs `make()` methods

* **`new`:** Allocates zeroed storage for a new item of a given type and returns a pointer to it. Used for values (e.g., `int`, `struct`).
    ```go
    p := new(int) // p is *int, value is 0
    s := new(MyStruct) // s is *MyStruct, fields are zeroed
    ```
* **`make`:** Used only for slices, maps, and channels. It initializes the internal data structure and returns an *initialized* (not zeroed) value of the type itself (not a pointer).
    ```go
    s := make([]int, 5, 10) // slice of 5 ints, cap 10
    m := make(map[string]int) // empty map
    c := make(chan int, 1) // buffered channel
    ```
  **Key difference:** `new` returns a pointer to a zeroed value; `make` returns an initialized slice, map, or channel type.

#### 5. Interfaces and basic concurrency (goroutines, channels)

* **Interfaces:** Define a set of method signatures. A type implicitly satisfies an interface if it implements all the methods declared in the interface. Go emphasizes *composition over inheritance* and loose coupling via interfaces.
    ```go
    type Greeter interface {
        SayHello() string
    }
    type Person struct { name string }
    func (p Person) SayHello() string { return "Hello, " + p.name }
    ```
* **Goroutines:** Lightweight, independently executing functions (often called "green threads"). Started with the `go` keyword.
    ```go
    go myFunction()
    ```
* **Channels:** Typed conduits through which you can send and receive values with goroutines. Used for synchronized communication.
    * `ch <- value`: Send `value` to channel `ch`.
    * `value := <-ch`: Receive `value` from channel `ch`.
    * `make(chan type)`: Unbuffered channel (sender blocks until receiver is ready).
    * `make(chan type, capacity)`: Buffered channel (sender blocks only if buffer is full).

#### 6. HTTP server development with `net/http`

* Go's standard library provides robust HTTP capabilities.
* `http.HandleFunc(pattern, handler)`: Registers a handler function for a given URL path.
* `http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)`: Starts an HTTP server on the specified address.
* `http.ResponseWriter`: Interface for writing HTTP responses.
* `*http.Request`: Struct containing details of the incoming request.
* **Example:**
    ```go
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, world!")
    })
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
    ```

#### 7. JSON handling and API development

* **`encoding/json` package:**
    * `json.Marshal()`: Converts Go structs/maps to JSON byte slices. Fields must be exported (start with a capital letter) to be marshaled. Use `json:"fieldName"` struct tags for custom JSON field names.
    * `json.Unmarshal()`: Parses JSON byte slices into Go structs/maps.
* **API Development:** Combine `net/http` for routing and `encoding/json` for request/response serialization.

#### 8. Basic testing and error handling

* **Testing:** Go's built-in testing framework (`testing` package).
    * Test files end with `_test.go`. Test functions start with `Test` and take `*testing.T` as an argument.
    * `go test` command to run tests.
    * `t.Errorf()`, `t.Fatalf()` for test failures.
* **Error Handling:** Go doesn't use exceptions. Errors are returned as the last return value (usually `error` interface type).
    ```go
    result, err := someFunc()
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }
    ```

#### 9. Basic understanding of pointers, when to use them.

* **Pointers:** Variables that store the memory address of another variable.
    * `&` (address-of operator): Gives the memory address of a variable.
    * `*` (dereference operator): Accesses the value at a memory address.
* **When to use:**
    * Modifying a value outside the current scope (e.g., passing large structs to functions by pointer to avoid copying).
    * Implementing data structures like linked lists or trees.
    * Indicating "no value" (`nil` pointer).

#### 10. Goroutines, channels, and concurrency patterns (worker pools, fan-in/fan-out)

* **Goroutines & Channels:** (See point 5) Foundation of Go concurrency.
* **Worker Pools:** A fixed number of goroutines (workers) process a queue of jobs from a channel. This limits concurrent operations.
    ```go
    // Example: Launch N worker goroutines, send jobs on a channel, collect results
    jobs := make(chan Job, N_JOBS)
    results := make(chan Result, N_JOBS)
    for w := 1; w <= N_WORKERS; w++ {
        go worker(w, jobs, results) // worker reads from jobs, writes to results
    }
    // Send jobs...
    // Collect results...
    ```
* **Fan-in/Fan-out:**
    * **Fan-out:** Distributing tasks from a single channel to multiple worker goroutines.
    * **Fan-in:** Collecting results from multiple worker goroutines into a single channel.

#### 11. Context package for cancellation and timeouts

* **`context` package:** Provides a way to carry deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between goroutines.
* `context.Background()`: Root context, never canceled.
* `context.TODO()`: Placeholder when you're unsure which context to use.
* `context.WithCancel(parentCtx)`: Returns a new context and a cancel function.
* `context.WithTimeout(parentCtx, duration)`: Returns a new context and a cancel function, context is canceled after `duration`.
* `context.WithDeadline(parentCtx, time)`: Similar to `WithTimeout`, but with an absolute time.
* Used heavily in network requests, database operations, and long-running tasks to prevent resource leaks and allow graceful shutdown.

#### 12. Interface design and composition over inheritance

* **Interface Design:** Focus on *what an object can do* rather than *what it is*. Small interfaces are preferred ("single responsibility principle").
* **Composition over Inheritance:** Go does not support class-based inheritance. Instead, you achieve code reuse and polymorphism by embedding structs and using interfaces.
    * **Embedding:** A struct can embed another struct, promoting its fields and methods. This is "composition" in Go's terminology, not inheritance.
    ```go
    type Engine struct { /* ... */ }
    type Car struct { Engine; /* ... */ } // Car "has a" Engine
    ```
    * **Interfaces:** Allow different types to be treated uniformly if they implement the same interface.

#### 13. Memory management, garbage collection, and performance optimization

* **Memory Management:** Go manages memory automatically.
* **Garbage Collection (GC):** Go uses a concurrent, tri-color mark-and-sweep garbage collector. It aims for low-latency pauses.
    * Understands stack vs. heap allocation. Small, short-lived values might be allocated on the stack (escapes analysis).
* **Performance Optimization:**
    * Minimize allocations (reduces GC pressure).
    * Use appropriate data structures.
    * Avoid unnecessary string concatenations (use `strings.Builder`).
    * Profile your code using `pprof` (`go tool pprof`).
    * Benchmarking (`go test -bench=.`).

#### 14. Error handling patterns and custom error types

* **Error Handling Patterns:**
    * **Sentinel Errors:** Predefined global error variables (e.g., `io.EOF`). Use `errors.Is` to check.
    * **Wrapped Errors:** Add context to errors using `fmt.Errorf("%w", err)`. Use `errors.Unwrap` to get the underlying error and `errors.As` to check if an error in the chain is of a specific type.
    * **Custom Error Types:** Define structs that implement the `error` interface (`Error() string` method).
    ```go
    type MyError struct { Message string; Code int }
    func (e *MyError) Error() string { return e.Message }
    ```
* **When to `panic`/`recover`:** Only for truly unrecoverable errors (e.g., programming bugs, initialization failures). Not for expected runtime errors.

#### 15. Testing strategies (unit, integration, benchmarking)

* **Unit Testing:** Tests individual functions or methods in isolation. Focuses on correctness of small code units. (Use `testing` package).
* **Integration Testing:** Tests interactions between different components or services (e.g., database, external APIs). Might require setup/teardown.
* **Benchmarking:** Measures performance of code. Functions start with `Benchmark` and take `*testing.B` as an argument. Use `b.N` for loop iterations. (`go test -bench=.`)

#### 16. Go modules and dependency management

* **Go Modules:** Standard way to manage dependencies. Replaced GOPATH.
* `go.mod`: Defines the module path and lists direct and indirect dependencies.
* `go.sum`: Contains cryptographic checksums of dependencies for integrity.
* `go mod init`: Initializes a new module.
* `go mod tidy`: Cleans up unused dependencies and adds missing ones.
* `go get`: Downloads and adds dependencies.

#### 17. Handling Circular Dependencies

* **Concept:** When package A imports package B, and package B imports package A. Go's compiler will report an error.
* **Solution:**
    * **Refactor:** Break down the code into smaller, more focused packages.
    * **Interfaces:** Define an interface in one package, and the other package implements it. The first package can then depend on the interface, not the concrete implementation.
    * **Dependency Injection:** Pass dependencies as arguments or struct fields.

#### 18. Generics concepts and use cases.

* **Generics:** Introduced in Go 1.18. Allows writing functions and types that work with a variety of types, reducing code duplication while maintaining type safety.
* **Type Parameters:** Declared in square brackets `[]` after the function/type name.
    ```go
    func Map[T any, U any](slice []T, f func(T) U) []U { /* ... */ }
    ```
* **Constraints:** Define the set of types that can be used for a type parameter (e.g., `comparable`, `constraints.Ordered`).
* **Use Cases:**
    * Generic data structures (lists, stacks, queues).
    * Generic functions (map, filter, reduce).
    * Algorithms that work on various numeric types.

#### 19. Familiarity with key packages like `net/http`, `io`, `fmt`, `encoding/json`, `context`, `time`, `sync`, `os`.

* **`net/http`:** (Covered above) HTTP client and server.
* **`io`:** Basic I/O primitives (e.g., `Reader`, `Writer` interfaces).
* **`fmt`:** Formatted I/O (printing, scanning).
* **`encoding/json`:** (Covered above) JSON encoding/decoding.
* **`context`:** (Covered above) Propagating deadlines, cancellation signals.
* **`time`:** Time and duration manipulation.
* **`sync`:** Synchronization primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RWMutex`, `WaitGroup`, `Once`). Essential for safe concurrent access to shared resources.
* **`os`:** Operating system interactions (file system, environment variables, command-line arguments).

#### 20. Advanced Topics:

* **Microservices architecture with Go:**
    * Go's small binary size, fast startup, and strong concurrency model make it ideal for microservices.
    * Discuss service discovery, API gateways, inter-service communication (REST, gRPC), eventual consistency, distributed tracing.
* **Design pattern in Go:**
    * **Creational:** Singleton (often via `sync.Once`), Factory.
    * **Structural:** Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy.
    * **Behavioral:** Observer, Strategy, Template Method.
    * Go's idiomatic way often uses interfaces and composition instead of complex class hierarchies.
* **Troubleshooting and debugging Go application:**
    * `fmt.Println()`: Basic logging.
    * `log` package: More structured logging.
    * `delve` (debugger): Command-line debugger for Go.
    * `pprof`: Performance profiling (CPU, memory, goroutine, mutex profiles).
    * Tracing with `trace` package.
* **Experience with Gin framework:**
    * **Gin:** A high-performance HTTP web framework, often faster than `net/http` for common use cases.
    * **Features:** Routing, middleware support (authentication, logging, CORS), request binding/validation, JSON rendering.
    * Be ready to discuss why you chose Gin, its pros/cons compared to `net/http` or other frameworks, and examples of using its middleware or routing features.

#### 21. Scenario based questions: e.g. designing a scalable API, handling high traffic.

* **Scalable API Design:**
    * **Statelessness:** Make services stateless where possible.
    * **Caching:** In-memory, Redis, CDN.
    * **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple instances.
    * **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pub/Sub) for long-running tasks.
    * **Database Scaling:** Read replicas, sharding, choosing appropriate database types.
    * **Monitoring & Alerting:** Observability is key to identify bottlenecks.
    * **Circuit Breakers/Rate Limiting:** Protect downstream services.
* **Handling High Traffic:**
    * **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more instances of your Go application.
    * **Efficient Concurrency:** Use goroutines and channels effectively without over-spawning.
    * **Non-blocking I/O:** Ensure network/disk operations don't block goroutines unnecessarily.
    * **Database Optimization:** Indexing, query optimization, connection pooling.
    * **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation under load.
    * **Resource Limits:** Set CPU/memory limits for containers.
    * **Network Optimization:** Keep payloads small (e.g., gRPC instead of REST for internal comms).

## Golang Interview Preparation Topics

### Core Language Fundamentals

* **Basic syntax, data types, and control structures**
    * **Syntax:** Go is C-like. No semicolons. `{}` for blocks. `package main` and `func main()`.
    * **Data Types:** `int`, `float64`, `bool`, `string`. Composite types: `array`, `slice`, `map`, `struct`, `channel`, `interface`. `byte` (alias for `uint8`), `rune` (alias for `int32` for Unicode characters).
    * **Control Structures:** `if/else`, `for` (Go's only loop construct, used for `while` and `for-each` too), `switch`. `defer` for ensuring function calls run after the surrounding function returns.

* **Functions, methods, and structs**
    * **Functions:** Declared with `func`. Can return multiple values (e.g., `(value, error)`).
    * **Methods:** Functions with a *receiver argument*. `func (r ReceiverType) MethodName(args) returnType`. Associate behavior with a type (often a struct). Can be value or pointer receivers.
    * **Structs:** User-defined composite types that group fields of different types. `type Person struct { Name string; Age int }`. No classes, but structs with methods provide similar OOP capabilities.

* **Anonymous, Closure, and Variadic functions**
    * **Anonymous Functions:** Functions without a name. Often used as inline callbacks or within goroutines. `func() { /* ... */ }`.
    * **Closures:** Anonymous functions that "close over" the variables from their outer scope. They can access and modify these variables even after the outer function has returned. Key for concurrency patterns and event handlers.
    * **Variadic Functions:** Functions that accept a variable number of arguments of the same type. Denoted by `...` before the type in the parameter list. `func sum(nums ...int) int`. Arguments are passed as a slice inside the function.

* **new vs make() methods**
    * **`new(Type)`:** Allocates memory for a *zero-valued* `Type` and returns a *pointer* to it (`*Type`). Used for any type.
        * Example: `p := new(Person)` gives `p` as `*Person`, with fields initialized to their zero values.
    * **`make(Type, args)`:** Allocates and *initializes* built-in reference types: `slices`, `maps`, and `channels`. Returns an *initialized value* of the specified `Type` (not a pointer).
        * Example: `s := make([]int, 5, 10)` creates a slice of 5 ints, capacity 10. `m := make(map[string]int)`. `ch := make(chan int)`.
    * **Key Difference:** `new` returns a pointer to zeroed memory; `make` returns an initialized, ready-to-use slice, map, or channel.

* **Interfaces and basic concurrency (goroutines, channels)**
    * **Interfaces:** Define a set of method signatures. A type *implicitly* implements an interface if it provides all methods declared in the interface. Go encourages small, focused interfaces. `interface{}` is the empty interface, meaning "any type."
    * **Goroutines:** Lightweight, concurrently executing functions. Launched with the `go` keyword: `go myFunction()`. Managed by the Go runtime, not OS threads directly.
    * **Channels:** Typed conduits through which goroutines can send and receive values. `ch := make(chan int)`. `ch <- value` (send), `value := <-ch` (receive). Provide safe, synchronized communication, avoiding shared memory pitfalls.
        * **Unbuffered:** Send blocks until receive, receive blocks until send.
        * **Buffered:** Send blocks only when buffer is full, receive blocks only when buffer is empty.

* **HTTP server development with net/http**
    * Go's standard library `net/http` is powerful for web development.
    * `http.HandlerFunc`: A function type that serves HTTP requests. `func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`.
    * `http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)`: Starts a server. `nil` uses the default multiplexer.
    * `http.HandleFunc("/path", handlerFunc)`: Registers a handler for a specific path.
    * **Request (`*http.Request`):** Contains method, URL, headers, body, query parameters, form data.
    * **Response (`http.ResponseWriter`):** Interface for writing the HTTP response (headers, status, body).

* **JSON handling and API development**
    * **`encoding/json` package:**
        * `json.Marshal()`: Converts Go structs to JSON bytes.
        * `json.Unmarshal()`: Converts JSON bytes to Go structs.
    * **Struct Tags (`json:"fieldName"`):** Used to control how struct fields are encoded/decoded to/from JSON keys. `json:"-"` to omit, `json:",omitempty"` to omit if zero value.
    * **API Development:** Combine `net/http` with `encoding/json` to build RESTful APIs. Handle requests, decode JSON input, process, encode JSON output.

* **Basic testing and error handling**
    * **Testing:** Go has a built-in testing framework (`testing` package).
        * Test files end with `_test.go`. Test functions start with `Test` (e.g., `func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T)`).
        * `go test` command to run tests.
        * `t.Error()`, `t.Errorf()`, `t.Fatal()`, `t.Fatalf()` for reporting test failures.
    * **Error Handling:** Idiomatic Go uses `error` as a return value.
        * Functions typically return `(result, error)`.
        * Check for `if err != nil { ... }`.
        * `errors.New("message")` for simple errors.
        * `fmt.Errorf("formatted error: %w", originalErr)` for wrapping errors (Go 1.13+).

* **Basic understanding of pointers, when to use them.**
    * **Pointers (`*Type`):** Store the memory address of a value.
    * **`&` (address-of operator):** Gets the memory address of a variable.
    * **`*` (dereference operator):** Accesses the value at a memory address.
    * **When to use:**
        * Modifying a value outside the current scope (e.g., passing large structs to functions to avoid copying).
        * Implementing linked data structures (linked lists, trees).
        * Receiver type for methods (pointer receivers modify the original struct, value receivers operate on a copy).

### Advanced Golang Topics

* **Goroutines, channels, and concurrency patterns (worker pools, fan-in/fan-out)**
    * **Worker Pools:** A fixed number of goroutines (workers) repeatedly take tasks from a channel, process them, and often send results to another channel. Good for controlling resource usage.
    * **Fan-in/Fan-out:**
        * **Fan-out:** Distribute tasks from one channel to multiple worker goroutines for parallel processing.
        * **Fan-in:** Collect results from multiple worker goroutines (via multiple channels) into a single result channel.
    * `sync.WaitGroup`: Used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish. `Add()`, `Done()`, `Wait()`.

* **Context package for cancellation and timeouts**
    * **`context.Context`:** A value passed through the call chain of RPCs, API requests, etc., to carry cancellation signals, deadlines, and other request-scoped values.
    * `context.Background()`: The root context, never canceled, has no deadline.
    * `context.TODO()`: Used when you're unsure which context to use, or if the function will be updated later.
    * `context.WithCancel(parentCtx)`: Returns a new context and a `cancel()` function. Call `cancel()` to signal cancellation.
    * `context.WithTimeout(parentCtx, duration)`: Returns a new context and `cancel()`, automatically cancels after `duration`.
    * `context.WithDeadline(parentCtx, time.Time)`: Returns a new context and `cancel()`, automatically cancels at a specific `time.Time`.
    * `select { case <-ctx.Done(): ... }`: How goroutines listen for cancellation. `ctx.Err()` returns the reason for cancellation (e.g., `context.DeadlineExceeded`, `context.Canceled`).

* **Interface design and composition over inheritance**
    * **Interface Design:** Go prefers many small interfaces over one large one. Interfaces define *behavior*, not *data*. Promotes loose coupling.
    * **Composition over Inheritance:** Go does not have class inheritance. Instead, it promotes *composition* by embedding structs within other structs. This allows types to "inherit" behavior by gaining the methods of the embedded type, but it's not a strict "is-a" relationship like inheritance. It's more of a "has-a" relationship. Example: `type ReaderWriter struct { io.Reader; io.Writer }`.

* **Memory management, garbage collection, and performance optimization**
    * **Memory Management:** Go uses a concurrent tri-color mark-and-sweep garbage collector.
    * **Stack vs. Heap Allocation:** Go's compiler performs "escape analysis" to determine if a variable can be allocated on the stack (fast, automatically cleaned) or must "escape" to the heap (slower, managed by GC).
    * **Garbage Collection (GC):** Runs concurrently with your program, minimizing "stop-the-world" pauses.
    * **Performance Optimization:**
        * Minimize unnecessary allocations (e.g., avoid creating large slices/maps in tight loops).
        * Use `sync.Pool` for reusing frequently allocated, temporary objects.
        * Profile with `pprof` (CPU, memory, goroutine profiles).
        * Avoid excessive string concatenations (use `strings.Builder`).
        * Choose efficient data structures.

* **Error handling patterns and custom error types**
    * **Idiomatic:** Return `error` as the last return value.
    * **Sentinel Errors:** Pre-declared error variables (e.g., `io.EOF`, `os.ErrNotExist`). Use `errors.Is(err, ErrSpecific)` to check if an error is a specific sentinel.
    * **Wrapping Errors (`%w`):** Use `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", originalErr)` to add context while preserving the original error in a chain.
    * **`errors.As(err, &target)`:** Unwraps an error chain to find a specific custom error type and assign it to `target`.
    * **Custom Error Types:** Define structs that implement the `error` interface. Provides more structured error information.

* **Testing strategies (unit, integration, benchmarking)**
    * **Unit Testing:** Testing individual functions/components in isolation. Use `testing.T`.
    * **Integration Testing:** Testing how different components or services interact. May involve mock external dependencies or actual minimal dependencies.
    * **Benchmarking:** Measuring code performance. Functions start with `Benchmark` (e.g., `func BenchmarkMyFunction(b *testing.B)`). Use `b.N` for loop count, `b.ResetTimer()`. Run with `go test -bench=.`.
    * `go test -v -race`: Run tests verbosely with race detector (crucial for concurrency bugs).

* **Go modules and dependency management**
    * **Go Modules:** The standard for dependency management. A module is a collection of packages defined by a `go.mod` file.
    * `go mod init [module path]`: Initializes a new module.
    * `go get [package]`: Downloads and adds a dependency.
    * `go mod tidy`: Cleans up `go.mod` and `go.sum` (removes unused dependencies, adds missing ones).
    * `go.sum`: Cryptographic checksums of module dependencies to ensure reproducible builds.
    * **Semantic Versioning:** Modules follow semantic versioning (vX.Y.Z).

* **Handling Circular Dependencies**
    * Go explicitly disallows circular imports between packages.
    * **Why?** Improves compilation speed, forces cleaner architecture, clearer separation of concerns.
    * **Solutions:**
        * **Refactor:** Break down tightly coupled packages into smaller, more focused packages.
        * **Interfaces:** Define an interface in one package (the "consumer" package) that the other package (the "producer" package) implements. The consumer then depends only on the interface, not the concrete type, breaking the direct dependency.
        * **Move shared code:** If two packages truly need each other, they might belong in the same package, or the shared functionality needs to be extracted to a new, independent package.

* **Generics concepts and use cases.**
    * Introduced in Go 1.18.
    * Allow writing functions and data structures that work with a *type parameter* rather than a specific concrete type.
    * **Syntax:** `func Max[T constraints.Ordered](a, b T) T { ... }` where `T` is a type parameter.
    * **Type Constraints:** Interfaces used to specify what operations a generic type `T` must support (e.g., `constraints.Ordered` for types that can be ordered).
    * **Use Cases:**
        * Generic data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists).
        * Generic algorithms (sorting, searching).
        * Reducing boilerplate code for functions that perform the same logic on different types.

* **Familiarity with key packages like `net/http`, `io`, `fmt`, `encoding/json`, `context`, `time`, `sync`, `os`.**
    * **`net/http`:** (Covered above) HTTP clients and servers.
    * **`io`:** Basic I/O primitives (`Reader`, `Writer`). Fundamental for stream processing.
    * **`fmt`:** Formatting I/O (printing, scanning). `fmt.Println`, `fmt.Printf`, `fmt.Errorf`.
    * **`encoding/json`:** (Covered above) JSON encoding/decoding.
    * **`context`:** (Covered above) Context for cancellation, timeouts, and request-scoped values.
    * **`time`:** Time manipulation (`time.Now()`, `time.Sleep()`, `time.Duration`, `time.Time`).
    * **`sync`:** Synchronization primitives (`sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`, `sync.WaitGroup`, `sync.Once`, `sync.Map`). Essential for safe concurrency.
    * **`os`:** Operating system functionality (file operations, environment variables, command-line arguments).

### Advanced Topics:

* **Microservices architecture with Go**
    * **Benefits:** Scalability, fault isolation, independent deployment, technology heterogeneity.
    * **Challenges:** Distributed transactions, data consistency, inter-service communication (RPC, REST, messaging queues), observability (logging, monitoring, tracing), service discovery.
    * **Go's advantages:** Strong concurrency model (goroutines/channels for efficient handling of requests), fast startup times, small binary sizes, static typing, good for building performant services.
    * Discuss how Go fits into a microservices ecosystem (e.g., as a backend service, API gateway).

* **Design patterns in Go**
    * Go often favors simplicity and idiomatic approaches over strict adherence to classic OOP design patterns.
    * **Commonly used/adapted patterns:**
        * **Builder:** Construct complex objects step-by-step.
        * **Factory Method:** Create objects without exposing creation logic.
        * **Singleton:** Ensure only one instance of a type (often achieved with `sync.Once`).
        * **Adapter:** Make incompatible interfaces compatible (often using interfaces).
        * **Decorator:** Dynamically add responsibilities to objects (often with function wrapping).
        * **Observer:** Define a one-to-many dependency (can use channels or callbacks).
        * **Strategy:** Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable (interfaces).
        * **Functional Options:** A Go-idiomatic pattern for configurable object creation, often replacing a large constructor with many optional arguments.
    * Be ready to explain how Go's features (interfaces, composition, functions as first-class citizens) simplify or adapt traditional patterns.

* **Troubleshooting and debugging Go applications**
    * **Tools:**
        * `go run`, `go build`, `go test` for initial checks.
        * **`delve` (debugger):** Command-line debugger for Go. Can set breakpoints, inspect variables, step through code.
        * **`pprof`:** (runtime/pprof, net/http/pprof) For profiling CPU, memory, goroutines, mutexes. Helps identify performance bottlenecks and memory leaks.
        * **Logging:** Use standard `log` package or a structured logging library (e.g., Zap, zerolog).
        * **Tracing:** Distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) for microservices.
        * **`fmt.Println` debugging:** Simple but effective for quick checks.
        * **`go tool trace`:** Visualizes execution of goroutines and events.
    * **Common issues:** Goroutine leaks, race conditions, deadlocks, excessive memory consumption, slow endpoints.

* **Experience with Gin framework**
    * **What it is:** A high-performance HTTP web framework for Go. Known for its speed and Martini-like API.
    * **Key features:**
        * **Routing:** Efficient URL routing.
        * **Middleware:** Ability to chain request handlers (e.g., logging, authentication, error recovery).
        * **Context (`*gin.Context`):** Wraps `http.ResponseWriter` and `*http.Request` and provides methods for JSON rendering, parameter binding, etc.
        * **JSON/XML/ProtoBuf rendering:** Easy serialization of responses.
        * **Parameter binding:** Easily bind request body/params to structs.
    * Be ready to show how you'd set up a simple API endpoint, add middleware, handle JSON requests/responses using Gin.

* **Scenario-based questions: e.g., designing a scalable API, handling high traffic.**
    * **Scalable API Design:**
        * **Statelessness:** Design API endpoints to be stateless.
        * **Load Balancing:** Discuss how to distribute traffic (e.g., L7 load balancers, round-robin, least connections).
        * **Caching:** When and where to apply caching (CDN, in-memory, distributed cache like Redis).
        * **Database Scaling:** Read replicas, sharding, choosing appropriate database types.
        * **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pub/Sub) for long-running tasks.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Protect against abuse and ensure fair usage.
        * **Monitoring & Alerting:** Essential for identifying bottlenecks and issues early.
        * **Resiliency:** Circuit breakers, retries with exponential backoff.
    * **Handling High Traffic (Go specific):**
        * **Goroutines & Channels:** Go's concurrency model makes it excellent for handling many concurrent requests without the overhead of threads.
        * **Efficient I/O:** Go's `net/http` package is highly performant.
        * **Connection Pooling:** Efficiently manage database and external service connections.
        * **Minimizing Allocations:** Reduce GC pressure under high load.
        * **Profiling:** Use `pprof` to find and eliminate bottlenecks.
        * **Optimized Data Structures:** Choose efficient Go data structures (slices, maps).
