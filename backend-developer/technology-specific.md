### Technology-specific Questions:

5. **Question:** Explain the concept of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). Give an example of an ORM tool.
   - **Answer:** ORM is a programming technique that converts data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. An example of an ORM tool is Hibernate for Java or SQLAlchemy for Python.

6. **Question:** How does caching improve the performance of a backend system, and what caching strategies are commonly used?
   - **Answer:** Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the need for repeated database queries or computations. Common caching strategies include time-based expiration, least recently used (LRU), and write-through or write-behind caching.

7. **Question:** What are the advantages of using containerization (e.g., Docker) in a backend environment?
   - **Answer:** Containerization provides a lightweight, consistent environment for applications, ensuring they run consistently across different environments. It improves scalability, resource utilization, and makes it easier to deploy and manage applications.
